# Evently

## Short description
Eventy is a handy app where guests can see and manage events that they are interested in. A guest can sign up for new events as well as see events theyâ€™ve signed up for already all within their terminal. Other features include seeing guests that are already attending the event, updating how many guests you are bringing and cancelling your attendance at an event. We used the Eventbrite API to access events at Flatiron school and seed our database with live examples.

## Install instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Setup database
    - Run `rake db:setup`
    - Choose seeding method
      - Small set of fixed data
      - Larger amount generated data
      - Pulling Flatiron School events from Eventbrite
4. Run `rake run`

**Note:** Seeding with real Flatiron School events from Eventbrite requires Eventbrite API key. 
Go to [Eventbrite API](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform), login to your Eventbrite account and request a key. 
Create a .env file in the root directory.
Save your key as `EVENTBRITE_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`
