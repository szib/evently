## Short description
Eventy is a handy app where guests can see and manage events that they are interested in. A guest can sign up for new events as well as see events theyâ€™ve signed up for already all within their terminal. Other features include seeing guests that are already attending the event, updating how many guests you are bringing and cancelling your attendance at an event. We used the Eventbrite API to access events at Flatiron school to seed our database with live examples.
